The scoring is as follows:
- If all three choose to cooperate, they each get 3 points.
- If all three choose to defect, they each get 1 point.
- If one chooses to defect and the others choose to cooperate, the betrayer gets 100 points and the collaborators each get 0 points.
- If two choose to defect and the other chooses to cooperate, the betrayers each get 2 points, and the collaborator gets 0 points.

The game is played for 5 rounds, and the total score is calculated at the end to determine the winner.
