The total contributions to this pool are then doubled and evenly divided among all players. Contributions are public and known to all players after each round. The winner is determined at the end of the 5 rounds, and is the player whose total of remaining points and the points earned from the communal pool is the highest. Be mindful of the final stage where you can have chance to vote to penalize others, typically driven by perceptions of unfair contributions throughout the game.",
