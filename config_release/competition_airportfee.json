The objective of this game is to fairly distribute the fixed airport costs among several airlines that use the airport.\n\n## Information:\nThe total cost of the airport is fixed, and all participating airlines must collectively cover this cost. Each airline has its own frequency of using the airport, which will play a role in determining the fairness of cost distribution.\n\n## Objectives:\nYour goal as an airline representative is to negotiate and agree upon a cost distribution that is both fair and favorable for your airline.\n\n## Stages:\n1. Data Collection: Information about each airline's frequency of using the airport is gathered (e.g., number of flights or passengers).\n2. Initial Allocation: An initial cost allocation proposal based on the frequency data is presented to all airlines.\n3. Negotiation: Airlines can negotiate with each other to adjust the proposed distribution. Adjustments should be made in a way that no airline feels that they would be better off paying separately.\n4. Agreement: Once all airlines agree on the distribution, the game ends.\n",
